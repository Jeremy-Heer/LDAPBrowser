# LDAP Browser Tree Expander Enhancement

## Issue Fixed

The LDAP browser tree was not showing expanders for all entries that could potentially have children. Specifically, entries like `ou=people,dc=example,dc=com` that contained child entries were not displaying expander arrows, making it impossible to browse their contents.

## Root Cause

1. **Incomplete `hasChildren` detection**: The original `hasChildren()` method in `LdapService` was too conservative and would return `false` if there were any LDAP exceptions (like permission issues)
2. **Missing object class-based heuristics**: The system wasn't using object class information to predict which entries might have children
3. **No fallback mechanism**: If the initial children check failed, entries would never get expanders

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `hasChildren` Detection in LdapService

```java
private boolean hasChildren(LDAPConnection connection, String dn) {
    try {
        // Primary check: try to find actual children
        SearchRequest searchRequest = new SearchRequest(dn, SearchScope.ONE, 
            Filter.createPresenceFilter("objectClass"));
        searchRequest.setSizeLimit(1);
        searchRequest.setTimeLimitSeconds(5); // Add timeout
        
        SearchResult result = connection.search(searchRequest);
        return result.getEntryCount() > 0;
    } catch (LDAPException e) {
        // Fallback: check object classes to predict if entry might have children
        try {
            SearchRequest entryRequest = new SearchRequest(dn, SearchScope.BASE, 
                Filter.createPresenceFilter("objectClass"));
            SearchResult entryResult = connection.search(entryRequest);
            if (entryResult.getEntryCount() > 0) {
                SearchResultEntry entry = entryResult.getSearchEntries().get(0);
                String[] objectClasses = entry.getAttributeValues("objectClass");
                if (objectClasses != null) {
                    for (String oc : objectClasses) {
                        String lowerOc = oc.toLowerCase();
                        // Assume these types typically have children
                        if (lowerOc.contains("organizationalunit") || 
                            lowerOc.contains("organization") ||
                            lowerOc.contains("container") ||
                            lowerOc.contains("domain") ||
                            lowerOc.contains("dcobject") ||
                            lowerOc.contains("builtindomain")) {
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (LDAPException ignored) {
            // If we still can't determine, err on the side of showing an expander
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### 2. Smart Expander Logic in LdapTreeGrid

Added helper methods to determine which entries should show expanders:

```java
/**
 * Ensure that entries that typically have children are marked as such
 */
private void ensureHasChildrenFlagIsSet(LdapEntry entry) {
    if (!entry.isHasChildren() && shouldShowExpanderForEntry(entry)) {
        entry.setHasChildren(true);
    }
}

/**
 * Determine if an entry should show an expander based on its object classes
 */
private boolean shouldShowExpanderForEntry(LdapEntry entry) {
    // Check all object classes for container-like types
    for (String oc : entry.getAttributeValues("objectClass")) {
        String lowerOc = oc.toLowerCase();
        if (lowerOc.contains("organizationalunit") ||
            lowerOc.contains("organization") ||
            lowerOc.contains("container") ||
            lowerOc.contains("domain") ||
            lowerOc.contains("dcobject") ||
            lowerOc.contains("builtindomain")) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Tree Loading Logic

Modified all tree loading methods to use the new logic:

- `loadRootEntries()` - Now checks for potential children and adds expanders
- `loadRootDSEWithNamingContexts()` - Enhanced with smart expander detection  
- `loadChildren()` - Improved error handling and child detection

### 4. Dynamic Expander Removal

If an entry is expanded but has no actual children, the expander is automatically removed:

```java
if (children.isEmpty()) {
    // If no children found, mark as no longer having children and collapse
    parent.setHasChildren(false);
    dataProvider.refreshItem(parent);
    collapse(parent);
    showNotification("No child entries found under " + parent.getDn(), 
        NotificationVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY);
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Initial Load**: When entries are loaded, the system now:
   - Checks if they actually have children (primary method)
   - Falls back to object class analysis if the primary check fails
   - Shows expanders for any entry that might contain children

2. **Expansion**: When a user clicks an expander:
   - The system attempts to load actual children
   - If children exist, they are displayed with their own smart expanders
   - If no children exist, the expander is removed and the node collapses

3. **Object Class Heuristics**: Entries with these object classes will show expanders:
   - `organizationalUnit`
   - `organization` 
   - `container`
   - `domain`
   - `dcObject`
   - `builtinDomain`

## Benefits

✅ **All potentially browsable entries now show expanders**  
✅ **Better user experience** - no missing navigation options  
✅ **Robust error handling** - works even with permission restrictions  
✅ **Self-correcting** - removes expanders from entries with no children  
✅ **Performance optimized** - uses size limits and timeouts  

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Connect to your LDAP server
2. Browse to entries like `dc=example,dc=com`
3. Verify that `ou=people,dc=example,dc=com` and similar entries now show expanders
4. Click the expanders to browse child entries
5. Entries with no children will have their expanders automatically removed after expansion

The enhancement ensures that all LDAP entries that could potentially contain children will display expander arrows, making the LDAP browser fully navigable.
