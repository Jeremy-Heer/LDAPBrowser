# New Entry Form Enhancement - Persistent Data & Entry Links

## Overview
Enhanced the New Entry tab in the LDAP Browser to improve user experience by keeping form data after entry creation and providing clickable links to newly created entries.

## Feature Details

### Location
- **Tab**: LDAP Browser  
- **Sub-tab**: New Entry
- **Enhancement**: Form persistence and entry link creation

## Changes Made

### 1. Form Persistence
**Previous Behavior**: After clicking "Create Entry", the form was automatically cleared (via `clearAll()`)

**New Behavior**: After successful entry creation:
- ✅ Form data remains intact (DN, template selection, attributes)
- ✅ User can immediately create similar entries without re-entering data
- ✅ "Clear All" button still available for manual form clearing

### 2. Entry Link Creation  
**New Feature**: After successful entry creation, a clickable link appears below the buttons showing:
- 📎 External link icon
- 📄 "Created entry: [DN]" text
- 🖱️ Clickable interface (currently shows notification, ready for future navigation integration)

### 3. Visual Design
**Entry Link Styling**:
- Blue external link icon (16px)
- Blue underlined text with pointer cursor
- Positioned below the button row with top margin
- Professional, clickable appearance

### 4. Container Management
**Entry Link Container**:
- Initially hidden
- Becomes visible after first entry creation
- Accumulates multiple entry links for batch creation sessions
- Cleared when "Clear All" button is used

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `/src/main/java/com/example/ldapbrowser/ui/components/NewEntryTab.java`

### New Components Added
- `VerticalLayout entryLinkContainer` - Container for entry links
- `createEntryLink(String dn)` method - Creates clickable entry links
- Enhanced `clearAll()` method - Clears both form and entry links

### Code Changes
1. **Removed automatic form clearing** from `createEntry()` method
2. **Added entry link creation** after successful entry creation
3. **Enhanced clearAll()** to manage entry links container
4. **Added link container** to main layout

### User Experience Flow
1. User fills in New Entry form
2. Clicks "Create Entry" button
3. ✅ **NEW**: Form data remains for easy reuse
4. ✅ **NEW**: Link to created entry appears below buttons
5. User can:
   - Create another similar entry immediately
   - Click entry link (ready for future navigation features)
   - Use "Clear All" to reset everything

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
The entry links are designed to support future navigation features:
- Click to navigate to entry in LDAP tree
- Click to open entry in attribute editor
- Click to copy DN to clipboard
- Integration with main LDAP browser navigation

## Benefits
- ⚡ **Faster Workflow**: No need to re-enter similar data
- 📝 **Better UX**: Visual confirmation of created entries
- 🔄 **Batch Operations**: Easier to create multiple similar entries
- 🎯 **Future Ready**: Foundation for entry navigation features

## Testing
The feature is ready for testing:
1. Navigate to LDAP Browser → New Entry tab
2. Fill in entry details and create an entry
3. Observe form persistence and entry link appearance
4. Test "Clear All" functionality
5. Create multiple entries to see link accumulation
