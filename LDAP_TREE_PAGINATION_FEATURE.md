# LDAP Tree Pagination Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the LDAP browser tree to support pagination when expanding entries with more than 100 child entries, removing the error popup and providing user-friendly navigation controls.

## Problem Solved
Previously, when expanding LDAP entries with more than 100 child entries, the browser would:
- Show an error popup saying "more than 100 children found"
- Display only the first 100 entries
- Provide no way to access the remaining entries

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced LdapService for Paging Support ✅

#### New Overloaded Method
Added `browseEntriesWithMetadata(String serverId, String baseDn, int page, int pageSize)` method with:
- Page-based result retrieval
- Enhanced `BrowseResult` class with pagination metadata
- Support for determining next/previous page availability

#### Enhanced BrowseResult Class
Extended with pagination properties:
```java
private final int currentPage;
private final int pageSize; 
private final boolean hasNextPage;
private final boolean hasPrevPage;
```

### 2. Smart Pagination Controls in LdapTreeGrid ✅

#### Pagination Control Entries
- Special pagination entries appear when size limits are exceeded
- Display format: "Page X - ◀ Previous | Next ▶"
- Clickable controls for navigation
- Distinct visual styling with primary color icons

#### Paging State Management
- `Map<String, Integer> entryPageState` tracks current page per parent DN
- Automatic page state clearing when tree is refreshed
- Seamless integration with existing tree structure

### 3. User-Friendly Navigation Dialog ✅

#### Interactive Pagination
When users click on pagination controls:
- Modal dialog opens with clear navigation options
- Separate buttons for "◀ Previous Page" and "Next Page ▶"
- Current page information display
- Immediate tree refresh with new page data

#### Error Popup Removal
- Replaced error notifications with informational success messages
- Contextual messaging: "Loaded page X (Y entries) - Use pagination controls to navigate"
- No more disruptive red error popups

### 4. Enhanced User Experience ✅

#### Visual Indicators
- Pagination entries show ellipsis icon (⋯) in primary color
- Clear distinction from regular LDAP entries
- Hover cursor changes to pointer for clickability

#### Seamless Integration
- Pagination works with existing tree expansion/collapse
- Maintains current selection behavior for non-pagination entries
- Preserves all existing keyboard navigation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Page Size Configuration
- Default page size: 100 entries per page
- Configurable via `PAGE_SIZE` constant
- Efficient server-side limiting reduces memory usage

### Smart Result Handling
- Client-side pagination for smaller result sets
- Server-side size limiting for large directories
- Graceful handling of LDAP size limit exceptions

### State Management
- Per-parent paging state prevents conflicts
- Automatic cleanup on tree operations
- Persistent navigation context

## Usage Instructions

### Expanding Large Directories
1. **Expand Entry**: Click the tree expander on entries with many children
2. **View Page Info**: See notification showing current page and total entries loaded
3. **Navigate Pages**: Click on pagination control entry (⋯ icon)
4. **Choose Direction**: Select "Previous Page" or "Next Page" from dialog
5. **View Results**: Tree updates immediately with new page content

### Visual Cues
- **Pagination Entry**: Shows as "Page X - ◀ Previous | Next ▶" with ⋯ icon
- **Success Notifications**: Green notifications replace error popups
- **Loading States**: Spinner icons during data retrieval
- **Navigation Dialog**: Clean modal interface for page selection

## Benefits

✅ **No More Error Popups** - Eliminated disruptive error messages  
✅ **Complete Data Access** - Users can now browse all entries, not just first 100  
✅ **Intuitive Navigation** - Clear pagination controls with directional indicators  
✅ **Performance Optimized** - Loads data in manageable chunks  
✅ **Seamless Integration** - Works naturally with existing tree behavior  
✅ **User-Friendly Messages** - Informative success notifications instead of errors  

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing tree functionality preserved
- No changes to entries with fewer than 100 children
- Existing keyboard and mouse navigation unchanged
- Previous selection and expansion behavior maintained

## Testing

To test the pagination feature:

1. Connect to an LDAP server with large directories
2. Navigate to entries with more than 100 children (e.g., `ou=people,dc=example,dc=com`)
3. Expand the entry - no error popup should appear
4. Look for pagination control entry at bottom of children list
5. Click pagination control to navigate between pages
6. Verify smooth navigation and proper entry loading

The enhancement provides a much better user experience for browsing large LDAP directories while maintaining all existing functionality.
