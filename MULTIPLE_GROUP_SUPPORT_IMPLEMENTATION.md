# Multiple Group Support Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds support for servers to belong to multiple groups, enhancing the LDAP Browser's server organization capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Model Changes

#### LdapServerConfig.java
- Added `Set<String> groups` field for multiple group membership
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `String group` field
- Added new methods:
  - `getGroups()` - Returns all groups this server belongs to
  - `setGroups(Set<String> groups)` - Sets all groups
  - `addGroup(String groupName)` - Adds a group to membership
  - `removeGroup(String groupName)` - Removes a group from membership
  - `belongsToGroup(String groupName)` - Checks if server belongs to a group
- Modified existing `getGroup()` and `setGroup()` methods to work with the new structure

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Dialogs

#### MultiGroupServerConfigDialog.java (New)
- Enhanced server configuration dialog with multiple group support
- Features:
  - Multi-select list box for group selection
  - Ability to add new groups on-the-fly
  - Displays available groups from both external and internal servers
  - Visual group representation with icons

#### MultiGroupInMemoryServerConfigDialog.java (New)
- Similar to MultiGroupServerConfigDialog but specialized for in-memory servers
- Includes in-memory server specific fields (port selection, test data generation)
- Same multiple group management capabilities

### 3. Updated Server Management Tabs

#### ExternalServersTab.java
- Updated grid to display multiple groups (comma-separated)
- Modified to use MultiGroupServerConfigDialog
- Added InMemoryLdapService dependency to access all groups
- Updated server copying to preserve all groups

#### InternalServersTab.java
- Updated grid to display multiple groups (comma-separated)
- Modified to use MultiGroupInMemoryServerConfigDialog
- Added ConfigurationService dependency to access all groups

### 4. Enhanced Navigation and UI

#### MainLayout.java
- **Critical Enhancement**: Updated `populateServers()` method to display servers in ALL groups they belong to
- Updated `populateGroups()` method to handle multiple group membership
- Enhanced highlighting system:
  - `updateDrawerHighlight()` now highlights ALL instances of a selected server
  - Added recursive highlighting methods to find all server instances
  - Servers appear under each group they're members of in the navigation drawer

#### GroupSearchView.java
- Updated to find servers using multiple group membership
- Modified `beforeEnter()` method to check all groups each server belongs to
- Uses `belongsToGroup()` method for more accurate group filtering

### 5. Constructor Updates
- Updated ExternalServersTab constructor to accept InMemoryLdapService
- Updated InternalServersTab constructor to accept ConfigurationService
- Updated all instantiation points in SettingsView and ServersTab

## Key Features

### Multiple Group Membership
- Servers can now belong to zero, one, or multiple groups
- Groups are displayed as comma-separated values in server grids
- Server configuration dialogs allow selecting multiple groups

### Enhanced Navigation
- Servers appear under ALL groups they belong to in the navigation drawer
- Servers with no groups appear under "Ungrouped"
- Group operations work with all servers that belong to the specified group

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-group configurations continue to work
- Legacy `group` field is maintained and synchronized with the new `groups` set
- Migration is automatic when servers are first edited

### User Experience Improvements
- Visual group indicators with folder icons
- Easy addition of new groups during server configuration
- Clear indication of server group membership in all views

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure
```java
private String group; // Legacy field for backward compatibility
private Set<String> groups = new HashSet<>(); // New field for multiple groups
```

### Navigation Logic
- Servers are duplicated in the navigation tree under each group
- Only one entry is used for selection highlighting (the first one found)
- Group operations include all servers that belong to the group

### Dialog Enhancement
- Multi-select list box with custom renderer
- Real-time group addition capability
- Integration with existing group data from both server types

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create a new server with multiple groups**
   - Verify it appears under all selected groups in navigation
   - Check that group operations include the server

2. **Edit existing servers to add/remove groups**
   - Verify navigation updates correctly
   - Test that servers move between groups as expected

3. **Test group operations**
   - Verify that group search includes all servers belonging to the group
   - Check that schema comparison works with multi-group servers

4. **Backward compatibility**
   - Existing servers should continue to work
   - Single-group servers should be editable with the new interface
