# Entry Comparison Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive entry comparison functionality to the Directory Search tab that allows users to select multiple LDAP entries from search results and compare their attributes side by side across different environments.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Directory Search Tab (DirectorySearchSubTab.java)

#### Compare Column
- Added a new "Compare" column as the first column in the search results grid
- Contains checkboxes that allow users to select up to 10 entries for comparison
- Validation ensures users cannot select more than 10 entries
- Real-time feedback when attempting to exceed the limit

#### Comparison Controls
- **Comparison Counter**: Shows the number of entries currently selected for comparison
- **Compare Button**: Enabled when 2-10 entries are selected
- Button becomes active only when minimum requirements are met
- Automatically switches to the Entry Comparison tab when comparison is initiated

#### Selection Management
- Maintains selection state across pagination
- Provides visual feedback on selection count
- Clears selections when search results are cleared
- Remembers selections when navigating between pages

### 2. Entry Comparison Tab (EntryComparisonTab.java)

#### Comparison Table
- **Dynamic Columns**: Creates a column for each selected entry showing:
  - Environment name
  - Truncated DN for easier viewing
- **Attribute Rows**: Shows all unique attributes found across all selected entries
- **Smart Sorting**: Attributes are sorted alphabetically by default
- **Empty Cell Handling**: Shows empty cells when an entry doesn't have a specific attribute

#### Data Presentation
- **Multiple Values**: Multiple attribute values are joined with semicolons
- **Environment Context**: Each column clearly shows which environment the entry comes from
- **Responsive Layout**: Columns are resizable and flex to available space
- **Row Striping**: Enhanced readability with alternating row colors
